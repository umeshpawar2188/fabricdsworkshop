Without this customization, LLMs may not deliver optimal results tailored to the requirements and expectations of businesses and their customers. \n","\n","One straightforward approach to enhance the results is to manually integrate specific information into prompts. For more advanced improvements, fine-tuning LLMs with custom data proves effective. This notebook demonstrates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy, which supplements LLMs with dynamically retrieved and relevant information (e.g., business-specific data) to enrich their knowledge.\n","\n","Implementing RAG involves methods such as web searching or utilizing specific APIs. An effective approach is utilizing a Vector Search Index to efficiently explore unstructured text data. The Vector Index searches through a database of text chunks and ranks them based on how closely they match the meaning of the user's question  or query. Since full documents or articles are usually too large to embed directly into a vector, they are typically split into smaller chunks. These smaller chunks are then indexed in systems like Azure AI Search, making it easier to retrieve relevant information efficiently.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://appliedaipublicdata.blob.core.windows.net/cmuqa-08-09/output/fabric_guidance_genai.png\" style=\"width:1000px;\"/>\n","\n","This tutorial provides a quickstart guide to use Fabric for building RAG applications.

For deploying your own OpenAI models outside of Fabric, [Azure AI Studio for OpenAI](https://aka.ms/what-is-ai-studio) is recommended.
